#Quick-midi
Creating MIDI files from a notation based on [numbered musical notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbered_musical_notation) and TeX.

The original idea comes from a Mathematica program that generates and plays a sequence of note from a given input string with a 
similiar syntax, I found it on a BBS a long time ago but I can't find it anymore, so I'd like to credit its author here.

## Usage
```sh
quick-midi <input> [options]
```
Or
```sh
quick-midi -f <input file> [options]
```
The syntax of `<input>` and `<input file>`'s content is explained below.

## Notation
Here are some examples:

The well-known nursery song Fr√®re Jacques:
```
1231 1231 345- 345- {5654}_31 {5654}_31 15.1- 15.1-
```

A fragment of Cannon in C:
```
5{34}_5{34}_ {55.6.7.1234}_ 3{12}_3{3.4.}_ {5.6.5.4.5.17.1}_ 6.{17.}_6.{5.4.}_ {5.4.3.4.5.6.7.1}_ 6.{17.}_1{7.6.}_ {7.1217.16.7.}_ 1---
```

Happy new year

### Notes and modifiers
Basically, the input string consists a sequence of notes and directives. Each notes could be followed by some modifiers, modifying
their tone and durations.
